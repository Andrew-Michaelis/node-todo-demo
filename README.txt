for this project I intend to connect to a database in order to:
-add new database entries following a strict format
-reference specific database entries to alter visual aspects of the webpage
-have a random selector that chooses an entry and applies it without use specification

The general purpose of the project is to allow the user to fill out a form, which is then
checked for proper formatting before being submitted to the database as a new entry.
I will then allow the user to select from uploaded options on the database and each one will
alter the webpage to fit into the criteria listed within.

---MILESTONES---
✔Get the form submitting to database
-Get the form to check formatting before submitting (unneeded if I limit available inputs)
✔Create a delete option to clean up the database and remove entries (already there, actually.)
xCreate a delete all option to remove all things listed
✔Reformat the webpage to allow variables that denote aspects (such as color)
✔Make certain the webpage can change it's appearance (I expect this will be annoying)
✔Pull data from the database and set it to the variables denoting appearance (selector)
✔Make everything work (Minimum Viable Product)
xAdd fun features (random creation and/or selction of database entries)
